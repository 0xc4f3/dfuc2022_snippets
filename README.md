This repository provides the (quite sloppy) code base for submissions of Team FHDO to the Diabetic Foot Ulcer Challenge (DFUC) 2022, focusing on segmentation of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs). The challenge is associated with the 25. International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2022, its baseline paper is available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11618

The code base requires instructions and settings documentation to reproduce achieved results. These have been submitted as a method description via the Grand Challenge portal as well as to the conference management system to aid maintainers. Large files that are required for reproduction (e.g., models) have been stored on the German academic cloud storage Sciebo and are available at: https://fh-dortmund.sciebo.de/s/YyRq5b2WqxjUOZQ -- the required password for access has been submitted together with the mentioned method description.
